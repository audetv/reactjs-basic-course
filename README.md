### ReactJS. Basic Course.

Run:

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

`yarn build`


##### Updating Yarn to the latest versions

Should you later want to update Yarn to the latest version, just run:

`yarn set version latest`

Yarn will then download the most recent binary from our website, and install it in your projects. Don't forget to run a new install to update your artifacts, and to commit the results!
